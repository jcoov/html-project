<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Bitchin' Bitchin' You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler. We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers. So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out? You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler. It's just, sometimes... people don't really say what they're really thinking. But when you capture the right moment, it says more.</p>

<p>You act like you want me to be your friend and then you treat me like garbage. YOU BETTER RUN! She's our friend, and she's crazy! You're an idiot, Steve Harrington. You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler. Why do we even need weapons anyway? We have her. We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers.</p>

<p>You’re pretty cute, you know that? No... no El, you're not the monster. You saved me. Do you understand? You saved me. You’re going to take out the demigorgon with a slingshot? Friends don't lie. You are such a nerd. No wonder you only hang out with boys.</p>
